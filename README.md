# Ordering (Ordenamiento)
## Bubble Sort 

 > Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in 
 > wrong order.


## Insertion Sort
 
 > Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
